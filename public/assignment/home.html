        <h3>Assignment - 4 : Server Side Development</h3>
        <p>Up to this point we have been working mostly on the client, on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript running and rendered dynamically on a browser. We have been using a Node.js server mostly to just host and serve this content when requested from a browser. This module will expand on many more capabilities of Node.js as middle tier software.</p>

        <h3>Assignment - 3 : User Interface Development</h3>
        <p>In the previous assignment we created a static set of pages that served as a prototype of the Website. The static pages allowed us to explore content related issues such as page layout, styling, navigation, and other presentation related issues. In this assignment we will extend the prototype by making the pages dynamic. Angular.js will be used to implement data services, controllers, and single page navigation.</p>

        <h3>Assignment - 2 : User Interface Development</h3>
        <p>This assignment focuses on creating a set of static pages that will serve as a prototype. The prototype will allow evaluating user interface aspects of the application such as navigation, information layout, page dependencies, modalities, and authentication. Although the pages will have links, forms and buttons to interact with, the Website won't actually do anything yet. It will only be an empty shell for now. We will add the functionality as we progress through the rest of the assignments. All pages and content is responsive and mobile friendly.</p>

        <h3>Assignment - 1 : Development Environment</h3>
        <p>This assignment focuses on setting up the development environment. The development environment consists of a local Node.js HTTP server and a MongoDB database server where local development will be performed. It includes setting up remote Git code repositories and to onfigure the repository to auto deploy into a remote Node.js instance hosted at Heroku that will make the Web application publicly available on the Web.</p>
